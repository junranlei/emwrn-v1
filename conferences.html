The ARC NEER Research Cluster: The Early Modern Women Writers Research Cluster, gathered together twelve national and international scholars working in the rapidly expanding cross-disciplinary field of early modern women's writing. Identifying and linking existing areas of research strength in this area across a range of institutions, the group aimed to enhance Australia's already strong research reputation in this field by encouraging sustained collaboration between its members, nationally, internationally and across differing levels of experience. The organising principle and strength of the group was a shared interest in early modern women's textual practice. Its individual members work across a range of disciplines within English, including textual, historical and cultural studies, the history of the book, the new bibliography and electronic textual analysis.

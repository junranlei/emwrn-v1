N1 (p. 24): This is a song sung by the Prince of Corinth and overheard by Pamphilia and Amphilanthus. Unfortunately, music only exists for one song in the manuscript continuation of <i>Urania</i> (see N14), but we are told that this song is sung 'to an od kind of music' (24), although the prince's voice is 'suteable to his ditty' (24). Katie Larson (private communication) suggests that the idea of the song being odd might mean that it is unusual, rather than odd having a pejorative meaning, especially given the Prince’s ‘suitable voice’. (For song in Wroth in general see Katie R. Larson, <i>The Matter of Song in Early Modern England</i>, OUP, 2019.) The Prince’s song and state are provoked by his unrequited love for ‘a scornefull, senceles creature’ (27). The song is in the form of a sonnet using the kind of elaborate rhyme scheme found, for example, in Wroth’s uncle Philip Sidney’s ‘Astrophil and Stella’: ABAB BABA ABAB CC. </p>
<p>
<b>heart</b>: the tortured heart is a common image in Wroth’s poetry.</p>
<p>
<b>obscure all day/from me</b>: i.e. block out the day’s light. Note the clever use of enjambment where the break of the line mimics the obscuring. </p>
<p>
<b>vassal</b>: servant/slave. </p>
<p>
<b>Rebellions</b>: the political overtones in this poem are worth noting: the scornful lover is a ruler with a crown, rejecting the rebellion of the speaker, who is a loyal subject, but nevertheless one who will be crushed by ‘art’. Like so much of Wroth’s work, especially <i>Urania</i>, the vicissitudes of desire cannot be separated from anxieties over Jacobean foreign policy, forward Protestant demands for engagement in religious conflict, and some resistance to increasingly arbitrary monarchical power.</p>
<p>
<b>poor clay</b>: it what the body is fashioned from (in the story of Genesis).</p>
<p>
<b>new mould</b>: i.e. a refashioned body (clay in a new mould) as opposed to ‘welcome death’, which is the only escape from the frustrated lover’s torment.

                        <p>N2 (pp. 30-31): This poem is a remarkable example of the intersection between Wroth’s invented characters and their parallel figures ‘in real life’, as well as an example of how the fictionalisation enables Wroth to make some subtle points about her characters and about emotional and political contexts. This is a song composed by Amphilanthus and presented to Antissia ‘when hee made a shew of love’ to her (30), even though it was meant for ‘a higher beauty’ (that is, for Pamphilia). We are not told how the song has made its way from Antissia into Pamphilia’s repertoire; one can only assume that Amphilanthus presented it to her as the true recipient. The song was indeed written by William Herbert, Wroth’s lover and the ‘real life’ equivalent of Amphilanthus, and it exists in six extant manuscripts, ascribed to Herbert in three of them. So Wroth has taken Herbert’s song/poem, ‘given’ it to Amphilanthus, but imagined a situation in which Pamphilia would sing the song and thus underlines the irony of this male lament that is in a sense a have your cake and eat it too position: if only he had loved as women do, he would have been requited, but women are in fact unreliable, ‘ungrateful’, because of their being bound to the male lover’s desire. Because Wroth contrives to have the song sung by a woman rather than a man, it becomes part of her exploration of female desire in a world of casual misogyny. The fictional context is also ironic, because at this point in the narrative, Pamphilia is married to the King of Tartaria, and Amphilanthus is married to the Princess of Slavonia. Amphilanthus, in a fascinating example of politically significant wish-fulfilment, has become the Holy Roman Emperor, which would, if it happened in real life, offer a Protestant ascendancy in Europe, just as Pamphilia’s marriage offers a reconciliation between East and West.</p>

                        <p>N3 (p. 40): This is a song sung by a farmer’s daughter named Fancy who was initially resistant to the idea of being tied down to a domestic life: ‘mee thought a little mirthe was better then ties att home, brawling of brats, monthes keepings-in, houswyfery, and dairies, and a pudder of all home-made troubles’ (38). But having been scornful of her lovers she began to be conscious of growing old and being alone, and accordingly now regrets that she rejected the offer of marriage from the equally aptly-named Love, son of the King’s chief herdsman.</p>
<p>The poem itself takes the form of a sonnet in the so-called English rhyme scheme of ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GG. The poem intertwines images of desire and images that have a political implication: so, for example, hearts are rulers (sovereignising) free from the kind of courtly flatterers familiar to any in the Jacobean court. The control exerted over the victim of desire leads to rebellion, so that the person apparently empowered will end up as abandoned and as wanting in fulfilment as the speaker and her allies. The poem can also be placed in the tradition of female-voiced complaint (for an analysis see Rosalind Smith, Michelle O’Callaghan and Sarah C. E. Ross, ‘Complaint’, in Catherine Bates, ed., <i>A Companion to Renaissance Poetry</i> (Wiley Blackwell, 2018), pp. 339-52.), where ‘woe’s me’ is the cry of those who are abandoned by their lovers.</p>
<p><b>dear</b>: punning on most valuable and most beloved.</p>
<p><b>sovereignising</b>: ruling over (like a sovereign). </p>
<p><b>murdering pieces</b>: pieces are guns (that murder). </p>
<p><b>Nor caused nor furthering</b>: the ‘murder’ is the rejection of the one who desires, so there will be no advance possible. </p>
<p><b>humours</b>: in humoral theory, the four humours (yellow and black bile, blood, and phlegm) represented bodily and psychological states. By the 1620s the idea included the notion of what we might characterise as sensations and feelings, as alluded to here. </p>
<p><b>fleet</b>: from flout: reject or sneer at. </p>
<p><b>role/poor slaves</b>: this may mean rule poor slaves, or more obscurely roll as in disturb. </p>

                            <p>N4 (pp. 47-48): This poem comes from a masque staged by Pamphilia’s husband, Rodomandro, King of Tartaria. Wroth herself participated in the elaborate masques which were such a feature of the entertainment at King James’s court, dancing in Ben Jonson’s <i>Masque of Blackness</i> in 1605, for example. There are a considerable number of masques staged and described in both parts of <i>Urania</i>. The masque was rather like a combination of drama, opera and ballet, with spectacular scenery and special effects. The women who participated in masque performances, such as Wroth, had to have a considerable level of skill. This particular masque features masquers dressed ‘after the Tartarian fashion’ (46). The masque involves Cupid being berated by Honour for his wanton behaviour, and Cupid is in this process stripped of his bow and arrow and his wings. This song is Cupid’s response: a plea for forgiveness and a recognition of a higher power involved in Love. The masque and accompanying songs have some associations with the treatment of desire and of the figures of Cupid and Venus in <i>Love’s Victory</i>.</p>
<p><b>Crossed out line</b>: this may well have been more of a title than the first line of the poem, referring to Cupid.</p>
<p><b>Honour</b>: Honour is personified in the masque as outlined in the romance. </p>
<p><b>fall</b>: so Honour has replaced Cupid. </p>
<p><b>doom</b>: i.e. a decree, a judgement (OED). Honour, unlike Cupid, will not preside over a ‘light’ love, only a serious one. </p>
<p><b>mine arms</b>: so Cupid will lay the weapons that cause humans such anguish through their desire at Honour’s feet. </p>
<p><b>mortalings</b>: i.e. mortals, who in this image are subject to mortality and to the pains of desire. </p>

                            <p>N6 (p. 51): This is a song sung by Antissia during a fit of madness which will eventually be cured later in the narrative. Antissia is, like Pamphilia, in love with Amphilanthus, and his eventual rejection and also it would seem her creative impulses drive her into madness. Antissia goes on to marry Dolorindus, the King of Negropont. Antissia’s symptoms include taking on an equally unbalanced tutor in poetry. This particular song is sung while Dolorindus tries to deal with Antissia’s madness; it is described as a ‘tedious ditty, only noiseworthy but no way sensible’ (50). It is difficult to assess a poem/song which within the narrative is meant to be tedious and unworthy. </p>
<p><b>lusty gamesters</b>: gamesters can be sportive people and lusty can simply mean strong, but paired together they suggest sexual adventurousness (OED has gamester meaning someone who is licentious or we might say sexually adventurous, as a current meaning in the early seventeenth century).</p>
<p><b>Dian</b>: Diana, Goddess of the hunt, traditionally associated with chastity. </p>
<p><b>spirits</b>: where Wroth write ‘sprites’ she intends spirits, a word which carries a complex set of associations ranging from the modern idea of spirit as a person’s vigour (as in spirited) through to the idea of one’s own nature in a metaphysical sense. In a notable sonnet from the ‘Pamphilia to Amphilanthus’ sequence, ‘When everyone to pleasing pastime hies’ Wroth depicts the speaker as seeking respite from court vanities as she talks ‘with my spirit’. </p>
<p><b>Venus</b>: goddess of love, as in the famous painting by Botticelli, Venus, the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess Aphrodite, was said to have been born from the sea foam.</p>
<p><b>Juno</b>: goddess of love and marriage, wife of Jupiter. Antissia is stating that even in her ‘bliss’ (which implies possible sexual abandonment) she wants to be a ‘firm wife’.</p>
<p><b>Pallas</b>: Pallas Athena, goddess of war and wisdom. </p>
<p><b>Ceres</b>: goddess of agriculture, she symbolises fertility and was therefore associated with wedding ceremonies. </p>

The unusual structure with its two-syllable second and fourth lines in each stanza, might be intended to represent Antissia’s agitated state of mind, though at the same time the elaborate structure is perfectly controlled by Wroth. The speech that Antissia makes following on from the song is, however, much more clearly ‘deranged’ in its excessively flowery language (e.g. describing eyes as ‘flamigerous beacons’). </p>
<p><b>Antipodes</b>: the idea of the Sun spending winter in the antipodes reflects the notion that it is the sun revolving around the earth, rather than the reverse, which was posited by Copernicus in the mid sixteenth century. </p>

                            <p>N8 (pp. 74-75): This is a song sung by the King of Tartaria’s sister. She is overheard by Licandro, the Prince of Athens, who falls violently in love with her (see N9). She is described in considerable detail and summed up as a woman whose ‘rarenes sett harts on fire’ (76). </p> 
<p><b>holy fires</b>: this slightly disconcerting blending of the sacred and the profane evokes a Petrarchan image of desire. It seems unlikely that the image alludes to the so-called Holy Fire acclaimed as a miracle by the Orthodox Church since the fourth century. </p>
<p><b>murdering eyes</b>: like so much of Wroth’s poetry, eyes feature as both symbols of a gaze which positions women as objects, and as potentially redemptive when they can be used by the woman to counter that gaze. </p> 
<p><b>to Court again</b>: this is another example of Wroth offering a political angle to her treatment of desire: here Love is the ruler and men are summoned to Love’s Court. A distinction is made in the poem between those who acquiesce to Love’s demands, and those who resist and will accordingly be attacked by fierce love’s darts: i.e. Cupid’s arrows, which will therefore take control of desire away from them. </p> 
<p><b>martyr stakes</b>: this is potentially quite a chilling image given the very real execution of martyrs during the sectarian conflict characteristic of the early modern period. </p>
<p><b>Hecatombe</b>: deriving from the sacrifice of 100 cattle to the gods but generally meaning mass destruction. </p> 
<p><b>Phoenix</b>: the mythical single bird that immolates itself in flames and then a new bird arises from the ashes. The poem itself mimics this movement, as it returns in circular fashion to the images with which it began. </p>

Like the preceding poem, this one turns upon images of eyes, in this case the blue eyes of Licandro’s beloved. The poem also continues the interconnection between desire and political agency, especially the reference in the first stanza to ‘motives of government’. </p>

N10 (pp. 81-82): This is another song, this time one sung by a group of women who are servants to the Princess of Argos. The song is overheard by two callow young Princes, Lusandrino and Nummerandro, who are entranced by the ‘heavenly voices’ (81). </p> 
<p><b>Niobe</b>: In Greek mythology, Niobe boasted of her fourteen children to Leto, whose two children, Apollo and Artemis, respectively kill Niobe’s seven sons and seven daughters. Niobe turns to stone but weeps constantly so that water gushes from the stone, and so she became an image of constant grief, often associated with the complaint genre in poetry. </p> 
<p><b>flumes</b>: i.e. the water vapour from tears cannot quench the fire of Love. </p>
<p><b>sacred fire</b>: this echoes the holy fire image of N8. </p>
<p><b>earth, water, air, fire</b>: these are the four elements. </p>
<p><b>bait</b>: desire is like a bait on a hook which will lead those captured to be singed by love’s fire.

                        <p>N11 (pp.102-03): This is a song sung by Lindavera, the Princess of Frigia. She is disguised as a shepherdess and is overheard by three young princes: Antidorindo, Verolindo and Floristello. Her song is provoked by her love for the Prince of Albania, and we are told her ‘sweet Voice did express sadness, as her eyes did teares’ (102). </p>
<p><b>sacred fire</b>: presumably deliberately repeating the image from N10, this again emphasises the power of desire with a battle between the elements of fire and water forming a key part of the poem’s imagery. </p>
<p><b>water’s curstest ire</b>: the implication of this image is that the speaker/singer’s tears do not dampen the fire of Love. Curstest = most cursed. </p>
<p><b>his proud</b>: unclear but seems to mean Love’s pride ensures that she is trapped. If we take proud as an adjective, Love is proudly enclosing the speaker; if we take proud as a noun, it can refer to Love as a proud individual, with also some suggestion of sexual predatoriness. </p>
<p><b>Stanza 2</b>: this stanza explores the paradox at the centre of the poem’s depiction of desire: despite the water (tears) the flames grow stronger, just as the oil lamp burns fiercely yet the amount of oil remains the same (which is perhaps an allusion to the fact that the sacred lamp in the restored Second Temple was able to burn for eight days instead of the single day that the remaining oil should have fuelled). The paradox continues in stanza 3. </p>
<p><b>in toil</b>: in the manuscript a blotted t makes it possible that this word began as ‘not’ and was probably altered to ‘in’. </p>
<p><b>loving bays</b>: the bay tree (laurel) wreath, symbol of victory, especially a sign of an acclaimed poet, in this instance laid on the altar it seems to represent the speaker’s tribute/sacrifice for her unrequited love. </p>
<p><b>atom</b>: in the time when Wroth was writing, an atom referred to a minute particle and also the smallest unit of time (OED). The image in this stanza is then further developed so that at the end the speaker is an atom consumed by her unrequited love. </p>
<p><b>burnt by seeing</b>: the speaker is, in this final stage of the image of fire/desire, consumed by the sight of her love, who is rejecting her. </p>

                        <p>N14 (p. 137): This is a poem recited by Amphilanthus. (Unlike N2, there is no evidence that this was written by William Herbert and it did not circulate as widely as N2.) Amphilanthus is stricken because, believing that Pamphilia is betrothed, he is persuaded to marry the princess of Slavonia, but immediately regrets abandoning his vows to Pamphilia. This poem is a product of his melancholy and guilt: ‘I ame the shameless creature, the monster of sacred Vowes’ (138). </p>
<p>Gavin Alexander has noted that the first stanza is used as the lyric in a song ascribed to Alfonso Ferrabosco, which exists in a manuscript held at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. (See Gavin Alexander, ‘The Musical Sidneys’, <i>John Donne Journal</i> 25 (2006): 96-102). Alexander reproduces the musical setting keyed to Wroth’s version of the lyric. Katherine R. Larson has discussed the song at some length in her study <i>The Matter of Song in Early Modern England</i> (OUP, 2019), and a recording of the song is available on the companion website to Larson’s book: <a href="https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/emwrn/%E2%80%9Chttps://global.oup.com/booksites/content/9780198843788/%E2%80%9D">https://global.oup.com/booksites/content/9780198843788/</a>.  </p>
<p>A version of the poem with a number of variants is transcribed in an anthology that forms part of the Conway papers: see Daniel Starza-Smith, <i>John Donne and the Conway papers</i> (OUP, 2014), p. 241; like N2 this poems will be fully edited in Mary Ellen lamb and Katherine R Larson’s forthcoming edition of Herbert’s poems (MRTS, 2020).</p>
<p>The first stanza is about Pamphilia’s purported (but misrepresented) betrayal. Again we have an image of Love connected to tears, but in this case the tears are divided intro true (Amphilanthus’s) and false (Pamphilia’s, which are only love-like not truly signs of love): he has been betrayed by an ‘outward show’. </p> 
<p><b> [I]</b>: the manuscript does seem to read O rather than I although it is just possible that the curl at the top is makes it I. Roberts silently emends to I and I does make much more sense than O. </p>
<p><b>in mask</b>: this image continues the theme of the disconnect between outward show and truth, which is a common image in Wroth’s poetry, but usually from the perspective of the female victim of male duplicity. Amphilanthus himself is, generally, the guilty party, as his symbolic name (lover of many) implies. </p>
<p><b>guileful rain</b>: possibly linked to the Niobe image in N10, the idea here is that tears are false guides to sincerity, and that they do not show the grief of the person shedding them, but rather wear away the person (Amphilanthus) who witnesses them. </p>
<p><b>and seem to call</b>: Gosset Mueller edition of Urania Part Two and Roberts have ‘which’ seem to call. Manuscript looks more like ‘and’ but with extensive bleeding through from the other side of the page there is a possibility that it could be ‘which’, though ‘and’ seems more likely. </p>
<p><b>cumbered</b>: encumbered. </p>
<p><b>blow the coals</b>: again the fire/water imagery is used to show Amphilanthus’s despair as his flames are fanned. </p>
<p>The final stanza turns on the paradox of the speaker being undeserving, yet nevertheless being deceived by the apparent grief displayed by Pamphilia. </p>
<p><b>It was less fault</b>: Roberts has ‘For ‘for ‘Itt’. </p>
<p><b>unworthy</b>: i.e. less worth, he is not worthy.

                        <p>N15 (p. 144): This poem is part of a poetic exchange but the poems presented to Urania and Selarina do not exist: the manuscript has blank spaces for them, but Wroth has not inserted them (p. 142). This poem is presented by a shepherd to Amphilanthus as a kind of poetic tonic intended to cheer him up. The poem itself is a narrative which Josephine Roberts notes as being related to a song from the Portuguese romance <i>Diana</i>, by Montemayor (1559, English translation by Batholemew Yong, 1598). The song from <i>Diana</i> was loosely translated by Philip Sidney, and the first stanza was translated by Wroth’s father Robert Sidney (Philip’s brother). </p>

<p><b>bands</b>: i.e. bonds. </p>
<p><b>shines</b>: Roberts has ‘shines’, <i>Urania</i> edition has ‘climbs’: it is hard to decide between these but shines seems to make more sense in the context of the stanza and the overall poem’s treatment of the lock of hair. </p>
<p><b>to shadow hair is fled</b>: in this image, the hair cut from the lover is dead, like the love they once shared. </p>
<p><b>behold thy hair</b>: the tradition of a lock of hair signifying love and faithfulness is longstanding: the most commonly cited early modern example is Donne’s ‘The Relic’. </p> 
<p><b>wrack to my heart…lay the rack on shrivelled hearts,</b>: in the first half of this image the faithless eyes are sees as shipwrecking the heart, and then the ‘shriveled’ heart is laid on a rack to be punished like a victim of torture who is stretched on the rack. </p>

                        <p>N17 (p. 152): This poem, in the sonnet form of ABBA, ABBA, CDDC, EE, follows on shortly after the previous one: Steriamus recalls how (as depicted in the published Part One of the romance) he was at first in love with Pamphilia, until he was magically cured of this passion, and was able to return to his true love for Urania. This poem recollects the earlier love, and the idea that the memory remains even though he is loyal to his wife Urania. The memory (as evoked in the poem) does raise a quite powerful set of emotions in Steriamus, as he recalls his first love, ‘as hee was allmost like to have fallen into a dangerous passion. But Melissea had a careful hand over him, and soe he fell onely into a pretty little frenzy for the time of olde love and memory’ (152). The entire poem is like a re-evocation of first love. </p>
<p><b>enfold</b>: the final couplet with its enfold/unfold end words, which are almost but not quite homonyms, evokes the paradox of love as a palimpsest where the second love overwrites but does not erase the first.

In the first instance, this poem is recited by a so-called ‘Cyprian lady’. She is the daughter of the Duke of Sabro, and during a description to Pamphilia and Amphilanthus of how she fell in love with Andromarko, she explains that she composed this poem while wandering in a wood. The poem is blown by the wind into the hands of Andromarko, and while running to retrieve it, the lady sees him and is smitten. Andromarko is equally smitten (and it turns out that they had previously fallen in love with each other’s pictures). </p>
<p><b>fantastic’s skill</b>: in early modern usage, a fantastic was an illusion, so the idea expressed here is that fancy is a skilfully-created illusion. </p>
<p><b>neither God not earthly sprite</b>: in this image Cupid is seen as transitional: not a God (as Venus is) but still a spirit, not an earthly being.

Here Andromarko is overheard by Amphilanthus and Pamphilia reciting this poem, which it would seem is intended by Wroth to be a variation on the previous poem: while this is not stated, one can perhaps assume that Andromarko, having obtained the previous poem, is reciting a slightly altered version of it. It is at this point that the manuscript breaks off, so we learn nothing more of this particular pair of lovers. </p>
<p><b>highest height</b>: changed from highest enthroned in N18. </p>
<p><b>Venus darling</b>: this alteration from N18, which does not explicitly mention Venus, stresses that Cupid is we might say a creature who mediates between humans and the Goddess Venus. </p> 
<p>While overall N19 is almost the same as N18, the mention of Venus coming from Andromarko’s mouth, rather than the lady’s, indicates how powerful desire is in this narrative, as we see it constantly undoing women and men equally.

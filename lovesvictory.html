                        Philisses: The characters in the play have loose associations with members of Wroth's family, crossing over genertions. So Philisses evokes Wroth's first cousin and lover William Herbert but also Philip Sidney; Musella Wroth herself but also Penelope Rich; Rustic possible Robert Wroth (Mary Wroth's husband) but also Robert Rich; Lissius perhaps Philip Herbert but also Mathew Lister and Simeana perhaps Susan de Vere and Mary Herbert, Countess of Pembroke.
                        Huntington begins with Philisses' lyrical soliloquy (possibly an actual song, though no musical settings for the play survive) about his unrequited (so he thinks) love for Musella.
                        The Collation throughout includes all differences between the two manuscripts including spelling and punctuation. Penshurst tends to replace no punctuation with punctuation and uses far more question marks and exclamation marks. It is evident that Wroth made numerous revisions at every level.

                        <p>reiecting mee: Silvesta's rejection by Philisses, which drove her to renounce Venus and embrace Diana, is part of the play's complex network of misplaced, misunderstood and trejected desire. While much is resolved by the end of the play (in Penshurst), a number of characters fail to gain their desire, and Silvesta concludes somewhat ambiguously by offering Forester her 'chaste love'.</p>

                            Climeana: Wroth changed the names Climeana and Simeana in Huntington to Climena and Simena in Penshurst.
                            At this point in Huntington while it is slightly unclear she seems to be indicating Climeana's song with the slashed S.

                            The song contest at this point in the play is the first of a series of competitions between the characters, perhaps in imitation of the
                            ecloguies at the end of each 'act' of Philip Sidney's <i>Old Arcadia</i>. Wroth extends these contests from songs, to riddles, to stories,
                            all connected to the genre of the <i>questioni d'amore</i> which dervived from Italian sources but was, by the time Wroth wrote, popular
                            in pastoral Romance as well as drama, see eg Julie D Campbell, <i>Literary Circles and Gender in Early Modern Europe</i> (2006).

                            Ru: Rustick's parodic song not only sends up pastoral clichés but at the same time underlines
                            how unsuitable a match he is for Musella. There is some uncertainty as to how much he might represent
                            Wroth's husband Robert, with Wroth's biographer Margaret P Hannay doubtful of any connection, but other
                            critics pointing to the way Love's Vitory seems to play out a fantasy of avoiding an arranged marriage to an unloved suitor,
                            given the apparent shaky start to Wroth's marriage and her later affair with William Herbert.

                            There remains some uncertainty about its import, with earlier opinion by scholars like Roberts

                            who note its common use in early modern manusvcripts to denote a pause, and also by a number of
                            women writers to mark an affectionate salutation.

                            but understanding tht he loves Musella: it is accordingly a strategic choice on her part, rather
                            than just a blind response. It is accordingly fitting that Silvesta (apparently acting for Venus)
                            arranges Musella's escape from marriage to Rustic.

                            I can nott ridle: another example of Rustic's unsuitableness as a partner for Musella,
                            one does wonder how his marriage to the witty and (at times) cynical Dalina will pan out.
                            Rustic's remarks again seem like a faint echo of Touchstone's conversation with William in <i>As You Like It</i>
                            concerning court versus country life -- though Touchstone satirises the former as much as the latter.

                            Mary Wroth's husband Robert Wroth, it is hard not to see some parallels given that Robert Wroth was a man much
                            more enamoured of country life than culture; he was the King's forester and shared James's love of hunting;
                            perhaps even more tellingly Ben Jonson remarked that Mary Wroth was 'unworthily married on a jealous husband'.

                            Phi: at this point, Huntington ends. The fact that this last page has the speech prefix for Philisses, which follows on directly in Penshurst, may indicte that there are missing pages from huntington, or simply that Wroth for whatever reason abandoned Huntington and produced a complete text in Penshurst -- I note this despite myself and Marion Wynne-Davies arguing elsewhere that one can see Huntington as perhaps deliberately unfinished or at least as being thematically suggestive in its unfinished state.

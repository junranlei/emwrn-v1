to envy the excellency of the inferiour Sex. I doubt 
</p><p>
not but the Reader will quickly find more then I 
</p><p>
can say, and the worst effect of his reading will be 
</p><p>
unbelief, which will make him question whether it 
</p><p>
be a womans work, and aske, Is is possible? If 
</p><p>
any do, take this as an answer from him that dares 
</p><p>
avow it; It is the Work of a Woman, honoured, 
</p><p>
and esteemed where she lives, for her gracious de-
</p><p>
meanour, her eminent parts, her pious conversa-
</p><p>
tion, her courteous disposition, her exact diligence 
</p><p>
in her place, and discreet managing of her Family 
</p><p>
     occasions,<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp5" class="foot">5</a>  and more then so, these Poems are the 
</p><p>
fruit but of some few houres, curtailed from her 
</p><p>
sleep and other refreshments. I dare adde little lest 
</p><p>
I keep thee too long; if thou wilt not believe the 
</p><p>
worth of these things (in their kind) when a man 
</p><p>
sayes it, yet believe it from a woman when thou 
</p><p>
seest it. This only I shall annex, I fear the dis-
</p><p>
pleasure of no person in the publishing of these 
</p><p>
     Poems but the Author<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp6" class="foot">6</a> , without whose knowledg, 
</p><p>
and contrary to her expectation, I have presumed 
</p><p>
to bring to publick view, what she resolved in 
</p><p>
     such a manner should never see the Sun;<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp7" class="foot">7</a>  but I 
</p><p>
found that diverse had gotten some scattered Pa-
</p><p>
pers, affected them well, were likely to have sent 
</p><p>
forth broken pieces, to the Authors prejudice, 
</p><p>
which I thought to prevent, as well as to pleasure 
</p><p>
those that earnestly desired the view of the whole.

     Under your blissfull bowres, I shrowding<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp42" class="foot">42</a> there,
</p><p>
     It seem’d with Nymphs of <i>Helicon</i><a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp43" class="foot">43</a> I talkt.
</p><p>
     For there those sweet-lip’d Sifters<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp44" class="foot">44</a> sporting were,
</p><p>
<i>Apollo</i> with his sacred Lute sate by,
</p><p>
On high they made their heavenly Sonnets flye,
</p><p>
     Posies around they strow’d,<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp45" class="foot">45</a> of sweetest Poesie.
</p><p>
 
</p><p class="center">
2
</p><p>
Twice have I drunk the Nectar of your lines,
</p><p>
Which high sublim’d my mean born phantasie.
</p><p>
     Flusht with these streams of your <i>Maronean</i> wines<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp46" class="foot">46</a> 
</p><p>
Above my self rapt to an extasie:
</p><p>
     Methought I was upon mount <i>Hiblas</i><a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp47" class="foot">47</a> top,
</p><p>
There where I might those fragrant flowers lop,
</p><p>
     Whence did sweet odors flow, and honey spangles<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp48" class="foot">48</a> drop.
</p><p>
 
</p><p class="center">
3
</p><p>
To <i>Venus</i> shrine no Altars raised are,
</p><p>
Nor venom’d shafts from painted quiver fly,
</p><p>
     Nor wanton Doves of <i>Aphrodites</i> Carr,<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp49" class="foot">49</a> 
</p><p>
     Of<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp50" class="foot">50</a> fluttering there, nor here forlornly lie,
</p><p>
     Lorne<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp51" class="foot">51</a> Paramours<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp52" class="foot">52</a>, not chatting birds tell news
</p><p>
How sage <i>Apollo, Daphne</i> hot pursues,
</p><p>
     Or stately <i>Jove</i> himself is wont to haunt the stews.<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp53" class="foot">53</a> 
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
4
</p><p>
Nor barking Satyrs breath, nor driery clouds
</p><p>
Exhal’d from <i>Styx</i>, their dismal drops distil
</p><p>
Within these <i>Fairy</i>, flowry fields, nor shrouds
</p><p>
The screeching night Raven, with his shady quill:
</p><p>
But Lyrick strings here <i>Orpheus</i> nimbly hitts,
</p><p>
     <i>Arion</i> on his sadled Dolphin sits,<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp54" class="foot">54</a> 
</p><p>
Chanting as every humour, age & season fits.
</p><p>
      
</p><p>
5
</p><p>
Here silver swans, with Nightingales set spells,
</p><p>
Which sweetly charm the Traveller, and raise
</p><p>
Earths earthed Monarchs, from their hidden Cells;
</p><p>
And to appearance summons lapsed dayes,
</p><p>
     There heav’nly air, becalms the swelling frayes,<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp55" class="foot">55</a> 
</p><p>
And fury fell of Elements allayes,
</p><p>
By paying every one due tribute of his praise.
</p><p>
      
</p><p>
6
</p><p>
     This seem’d the Scite<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp56" class="foot">56</a> of all those verdant vales,
</p><p>
And purled springs, whereat the Nymphs do play,
</p><p>
With lofty hills, where Poets rear their tales,
</p><p>
To heavenly vaults, which heav’nly sound repay
</p><p>
By ecchoes sweet rebound, here Ladyes kiss,
</p><p>
Circling nor songs, nor dances circle miss;
</p><p>
But whilst those Syrens sung, I sunk in sea of bliss.
</p><p>
      
</p><p>
7
</p><p>
     Thus weltring<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp57" class="foot">57</a> in delight, my virgin mind
</p><p>
Admits a rape; truth still lyes undiscri’d,
</p><p>
Its singular, that plural seem’d, I find,
</p><p>
     ‘Twas<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp58" class="foot">58</a> Fancies glass<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp59" class="foot">59</a> alone that multipli’d;
</p><p>
Nature with Art, so closely did combine,
</p><p>
     I thought I saw the Muses trebble trine,<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp60" class="foot">60</a> 
</p><p>
Which prov’d your lonely Muse, superiour to the nine.
</p><p>
      
</p><p>
8
</p><p>
Your only hand those Poesies did compose,
</p><p>
Your head the source, whence all those springs did flow,
</p><p>
Your voice, whence changes sweetest notes arose,
</p><p>
     Your feet that kept the dance alone, I trow:<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp61" class="foot">61</a> 
</p><p>
     Then vail your bonnets, Poetasters<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp62" class="foot">62</a> all,
</p><p>
     Strike, lower amain,<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp63" class="foot">63</a> and at these humbly fall,
</p><p>
And deem your selves advanc’d to be her Pedestal.
</p><p>
      
</p><p>
9
</p><p>
     Should all with lowly Congies Laurels<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp64" class="foot">64</a> bring,
</p><p>
     Waste <i>Flora’s</i><a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp65" class="foot">26</a> Magazine<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp26" class="foot">66</a> to find a wreathe;
</p><p>
Or <i>Pineus</i> Banks ‘twere too mean offering,
</p><p>
Your Muse a fairer Garland doth bequeath
</p><p>
To guard your fairer front; here ‘tis your name
</p><p>
Shall stand immarbled; this your little frame
</p><p>
Shall great Colossus be, to your eternal fame.
</p><p>
      
</p><p>
I’le please my self, though I my self disgrace,
</p><p>
What errors here be found, are in <i>Errataes</i> place.

Deare Sir, of late delighted with the sight,

Of your* four sisters, deckt in black & white

    Of fairer Dames, the sun near<a href="tenthmuse.html#ftm40" class="foot">40</a> saw the face,

(though made a pedestal for <i>Adams</i> Race)	 
</p><p>
Their worth so shines, in those rich lines you show.
</p><p>
Their paralells to find I scarcely know,
</p><p>
To climbe their Climes, I have nor strength, nor skill,
</p><p>
To mount so high, requires an Eagles quill:
</p><p>
Yet view thereof, did cause my thoughts to soare,
</p><p>
My lowly pen, might wait upon those four,
</p><p>
    I bring my four; and four,<a href="tenthmuse.html#ftm42" class="foot">42</a> now meanly clad,
</p><p>
To do their homage unto yours most glad,
</p><p>
Who for their age, their worth, and quality,
</p><p>
Might seem of yours to claime precedency;
</p><p>
But by my humble hand thus rudely pen’d

They are your bounden handmaids to attend.

These same are they, of whom we being have,

These are of all, the life, the nurse, the grave,
</p><p>
These are, the hot, the cold, the moist, the dry,
</p><p>
That sinke, that swim, that fill, that upwards flye,
</p><p>
Of these consists, our bodyes, cloathes, and food,
</p><p>
The world, the usefull, hurtfull, and the good:
</p><p>
Sweet harmony they keep, yet jar oft times,
</p><p>
Their discord may appear, by these harsh rimes.
</p><p>
Yours did contest, for Wealth, for Arts, for Age,
</p><p>
My first do shew, their good, and then their rage,
</p><p>
My other four, do intermixed tell
</p><p>
Each others faults, and where themselves excell.
</p><p>
How hot, and dry, contend with moist, and cold,
</p><p>
How Aire, and Earth, no correspondence hold,
</p><p>
And yet in equall tempers, how they gree,
</p><p>
How divers natures, make one unity.
</p><p>
Some thing of all (though mean) I did intend,
</p><p>
    But fear’d you’ld judge, one <i>Bartas</i><a href="tenthmuse.html#ftm43" class="foot">43</a> was my friend,

I honour him, but dare not wear his wealth,

My goods are true (though poor) I love no stealth,

But if I did, I durst not send them you;

Who must reward a theife, but with his due.
</p><p>
I shall not need my innocence to clear,
</p><p>
These ragged lines, will do’t, when they appear.

On what they are, your mild aspect I crave,

Accept my best, my worst vouchsafe a grave.

THE

PROLOGUE.
</p></div>
        <p>
 
</p><p class="center">
1.
</p><p>
To sing of Wars, of Captaines, and of Kings,
</p><p>
Of Cities founded, Common-wealths begun,
</p><p>
For my mean Pen, are too superiour things,
</p><p>
And how they all, or each, their dates have run:
</p><p>
Let Poets, and Historians set these forth,
</p><p>
My obscure Verse, shal not so dim their worth.
</p><p class="center">
2.
</p><p>
But when my wondring eyes, and envious heart,
</p><p>
    Great <i>Bartas</i><a href="tenthmuse.html#ftm45" class="foot">45</a> sugar’d lines doe but read o’re;
</p><p>
Foole, I doe grudge, the Muses did not part
</p><p>
‘Twixt him and me, that over-fluent store;
</p><p>
A <i>Bartas</i> can, doe what a <i>Bartas</i> wil,
</p><p>
But simple I, according to my skill.
</p><p class="center">
3.
</p><p>
From School-boyes tongue, no Rhethorick we expect,
</p><p>
    Nor yet a sweet Consort,<a href="tenthmuse.html#ftm46" class="foot">46</a> from broken strings,
</p><p>
Nor perfect beauty, where’s a maine defect,
</p><p>
My foolish, broken, blemish’d Muse so sings;
</p><p>
And this to mend, alas, no Art is able,
</p><p>
‘Cause Nature made it so irreparable.
</p><p class="center">
4.
</p><p>
Nor can I, like that fluent sweet tongu’d <i>Greek</i>
</p><p>
    Who lisp’d at first, speake afterwards<a href="tenthmuse.html#ftm47" class="foot">47</a> more plaine
</p><p>
By Art, he gladly found what he did seeke,
</p><p>
A full requitall of his striving paine:
</p><p>
Art can doe much, but this maxime’s most sure,
</p><p>
A weake or wounded braine admits no cure.
</p><p class="center">
5.
</p><p>
I am obnoxious to each carping tongue,
</p><p>

Such storms of woe, so strongly have beset her,

Her comfort is, if any for her be,

That none can shew more cause of grief then she.

How the bereaved Nine do daily fill

The bosome of the fleeting Air with groans,

And wofull Accents, which witness their moanes.

Unblest for ever by <i>Sol</i>’s precious Ray,

Or last of Life, defam’d for Funeral.

When this day yearly comes, let every one,

Cast in their urne, the black and dismal stone.
</p><p>
Succeeding years as they their circuit goe,
</p><p>
Leap o’re this day, as a sad time of woe.

I am unblest in one, but blest in nine.

Fair <i>Thespian</i> Ladyes, light your torches all,

Attend your glory to its Funeral,

To court her ashes with a learned tear,

Grave Matron, whoso seeks to blazon thee,

In crowning of her merits he would be

sumptuously poor, low in Hyperbole.
</p><p>
To write is easie: but to write on thee,

Truth would be thought to forfeit modesty.
</p><p>
He’l seem a Poet that shall speak but true;

Hyperbole’s in others, are thy due.
</p><p>
Like a most servile flatterer he will show

Though he write truth, and make the subject, You.

Virtue ne’re dies, time will a Poet raise

Born under better Starrs, shall sing thy praise.
</p><p>
Praise her who list, yet shall be a debtor

For Art ne’re feign’d, nor Nature fram’d a better.
</p><p>
Her virtues were so great, that they do raise
</p><p>
A work to trouble fame, astonish praise.
</p><p>
When as her Name doth but salute the ear,
</p><p>
Men think that they perfections abstract hear.
</p><p>
     Her breast was a brave Pallace a <i>Broad-Street</i><a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp97" class="foot">97</a>,
</p><p>
Where all heroic ample thoughts did meet,
</p><p>
     Where nature such a Tenement had tane,<a href="tenthmuse.html#fsp98" class="foot">98</a> 
</p><p>
That others souls, to hers, dwelt in a lane.
</p><p>
Beneath her feet, pale envy bites her chain,
</p><p>
And poison Malice whetts her sting in vain.
</p><p>
Let every Laurel, every Myrtel bough
</p><p>
Be stript for leaves t’adorn and load her brow.
</p><p>
Victorious wreathes, which ‘cause they never fade
</p><p>
Wise elder times for Kings and Poets made.
</p><p>
Let not her happy memory e’re lack
</p><p>
Its worth in Fames eternal Almanack,
</p><p>
Which none shall read, but straight their loss deplore,
</p><p>
And blame their Fates they were not born before.
</p><p>
Do not old men rejoyce their Fates did last;
</p><p>
And infants too, that theirs did make such hast,
</p><p>
In such a welcome time to bring them forth,
</p><p>
That they might be a witness to her worth.
</p><p>
Who undertakes this subject to commend
</p><p>
Shall nothing find so hard as how to end.

            The author is Anne Bradstreet’s brother-in-law, John Woodbridge. Woodbridge (1613-1695) was born in England, where he began his religious training at Oxford University. His Puritan convictions preventing him from completing his degree, he emigrated to New England in 1634. There he married Anne’s sister Mercy (1621-1691) in 1639. Woodbridge worked as a local politician as well as a minister. He returned to England between 1647 and 1663 where he was chaplain to the parliamentary leaders who treated with Charles I in the Isle of Wight, and then rector of Barford St Martin, Wiltshire. Following the political changes of 1662 Woodbridge once again left for New England, where he lived the remainder of his life (Paul C.-H. Lim, ODNB).
        </li><li><a id="ftm5"></a>
            Bradstreet maintained a household on the American frontier; she and her husband, Simon Bradstreet, had eight children (McElrath and Robb xviii, xv).
        </li><li><a id="ftm6"></a>
            Several Poems has “Author”.
        </li><li><a id="ftm7"></a>
            In 1647 Woodridge travelled to England, taking a collection of Bradstreet’s poetry, which until then had only circulated amongst family and friends, along with him. In London, ostensibly unknown to Bradstreet, he had the poems published (Hensley xv; McElrath and Robb xx, xxv). 
        </li><li><a id="ftm8"></a>
            Sixteenth century French poet Guillaume Du Bartas was one of Bradstreet’s literary role models. His “long verse description of the creation of the world” was translated into English by Joshua Sylvester in 1605, and “gained an immediate popularity that sent it through edition after edition until almost the middle of the century” (White 56).

            Nathaniel Ward (1578-1653) emigrated to New England in 1634 after being excommunicated from the Church of England. He became the first minister of the frontier community of Ipswich, where he came to know the Bradstreets well (Derounian-Stodola 134-5). Ward and his family returned to England in 1646, and his book The Simple Cobler of Aggawam in America was published a year later (ODNB). Ward’s publisher was also Stephen Bowtell, and “it is generally accepted that Ward used his influence as a successful author to secure an appropriate publisher on his friend’s behalf” (Derounian-Stodola 135).

            This poem has been attributed to Benjamin Woodbridge (1622-84), rector of Newbury, Berkshire, and John Woodbridge’s younger brother. John Woodbridge’s proximity to his brother Benjamin when he returned to England “must have made editorial collaboration almost certain” (Derounian-Stodola 134). Though his initials do not appear in The Tenth Muse, which has led Joseph McElrath and Allan Robb to wrongly attribute it to C.B. (Clement Barksdale, probable author of “I cannot wonder at Apollo now”), the initials do appear in Several Poems. Woodbridge was renowned as a non-conformist minister. Woodbridge undertook part of his studies at Harvard, but lived most of his life in England (ODNB).
        </li><li><a id="ftm28"></a>
            Kathryn Derounian-Stodola speculates that this may be Clement Barksdale (1609-87), Anglican clergyman, and publisher of “an anthology of verse tributes to his friends called Nympha Libethris (1651)”. Because of the very different style of the later poem “Upon the Author”, also attributed to CB, she suggests they are two different people (135).

Together with Henry Burton, Homes “founded one of the first Independent gathered churches” (ODNB).

            White believes H.S. may be Henry Stubbe (1632-76), “though he would only have been sixteen or seventeen when they were written” (265). He was, however, noted for his scholarly aptitude from an early age. He went on to become an author and physician (ODNB).

                         The author is Anne Bradstreet’s brother-in-law, John Woodbridge. Woodbridge (1613-1695) was born in England, where he began his religious training at Oxford University. His Puritan convictions preventing him from completing his degree, he emigrated to New England in 1634. There he married Anne’s sister Mercy (1621-1691) in 1639. Woodbridge worked as a local politician as well as a minister. He returned to England between 1647 and 1663 where he was chaplain to the parliamentary leaders who treated with Charles I in the Isle of Wight, and then rector of Barford St Martin, Wiltshire. Following the political changes of 1662 Woodbridge once again left for New England, where he lived the remainder of his life (Paul C.-H. Lim, ODNB).

                         In 1647 Woodridge travelled to England, taking a collection of Bradstreet’s poetry, which until then had only circulated amongst family and friends, along with him. In London, ostensibly unknown to Bradstreet, he had the poems published. (Hensley xv; McElrath and Robb xx, xxv).

                         Sixteenth century French poet Guillaume Du Bartas was one of Bradstreet’s literary role models. His “long verse description of the creation of the world” was translated into English by Joshua Sylvester in 1605, and “gained an immediate popularity that sent it through edition after edition until almost the middle of the century” (White 56).

                         This poem is probably by Benjamin Woodbridge (1622-84), rector of Newbury, Berkshire, and John Woodbridge’s younger brother (Hensley 299; Derounian-Stodola 134). John Woodbridge’s proximity to his brother Benjamin when he returned to England “must have made editorial collaboration almost certain” (Derounian-Stodola 134).

                         John Rogers (1630-84) married Bradstreet’s niece (White 362). Jeannine Hensley argues that Rogers was also more than likely the editor of the second edition. She argues that the lines “twice through the Muses Grove” and “twice drunk the Nectar of your lines”… could refer to a second reading, but more probably refer to the second edition.” She goes on “His final couplet is less ambiguous, especially when one knows that one whole errata leaf and a fragment of another remain in copies of this edition.” In the last lines he is “referring to this errata leaf and assuming the responsibility for the state of the text. Only the editor could know the errors and assume the responsibility” (xxvii-xxviii notes). A physician and college head, Rogers moved to New England as a child, and lived most of his life in Ipswich. He became president of Cambridge College, Massachusetts, in 1683 (ODNB). Rogers would have been about 47 years old at the time <i>Several Poems</i> was published.

                         Thomas Dudley (1576-1653), Anne Bradstreet’s father, was a committed Puritan. He emigrated to the New World in 1630 with his family, including and Anne and Simon Bradstreet (who married in 1628) (McElrath and Robb xv). He was an influential founder of the Massachusetts Bay colony, occupying official positions throughout his life. White writes that Dudley was “beloved and revered” by Bradstreet (293).

                         Possibly a reference to the work of English poet Richard Braithwait (1588-1673). In 1635 he produced <i>Anniversaries upon his Panarete; continued: with her contemplations, penned in the languishing time of her sicknesse. The second yeeres annivers,</i> two years after his wife’s death.  This may also possibly be a reference to the work of ancient Greek writer Aristaenetus (5th or 6th C BC), who wrote a fictional letter to the female pantomime Panrete, whom he dubs ‘Proteus’ because of her versatility (EP.1.26).
